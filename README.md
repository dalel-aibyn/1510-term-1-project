## Any important comments you'd like to make about your work:

I got the idea for the project very early on. I liked it but I was more passionate about actually making the game.

Sorry for making it 7x7, 5x5 felt too small for my idea.

I won't deny that the game is insanely hard to play without a calculator.

Also, I just noticed that you don't want to type things. :\
